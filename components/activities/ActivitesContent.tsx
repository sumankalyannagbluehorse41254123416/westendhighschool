          Each child entering West End high School&nbsp; is placed in a House and
          is gradually introduced to the ethos of the institution. Each house
          has a House Master and House Mistress to whom he/she may turn for
          assistance at any time. All students from class II and above are
          placed in four houses and all activities academic, co-curricular and
          intramural is based on Inter-House competitions..

        The house system was devised to promote team spirit and a sense of
        belonging to the school. Also, this enables the senior students of the
        school to more systematically provide care and help to their junior
        schoolmates. The House System provides excellent opportunities for
        student leadership and peer group support, aided by dedicated staff
        members, and house captains. It is a remarkable medium for enabling
        students of different ages to bond together and operate as a cohesive
        family. The House system helps support and co-ordinate the corporate
        life of the school and develops the athletic side of school life along
        with the purely scholastic aspect, and thereby attains the goal of a
        liberal education, namely &quot; a healthy mind in a healthy body. &quot;
        The House system provides students with support and encouragement during
        their academic and co-curricular activities.
        <br /><br />
        Through the daily contact time of morning roll call and a 30-minute
        House Assembly per fortnight, House staff are able to monitor their
        students&apos; progress and cultivate positive relationships. Academic
        follow-up is considered a high priority, and thereby much attention is
        given to individual students concerning study support and guidance.
        <br /><br />
        The system provides an exciting division of the mass of pupils into
        units wherein each pupil has a rightful place and in which he takes
        pride. Houses are a common and successful way of building a superb
        school community and spirit. The houses compete in different sporting,
        cultural, and academic competitions, and provide an excellent way of
        meeting people outside one&apos;s own class and age group, all of whom
        have a common goal and purpose.
