          Clay Modelling is taught from the Pre-primary to the Secondary level
          and is a perennial favourite of the children. The tactile, hands-on
          nature of this activity makes it engrossing for all age groups and
          also offers scope for a high degree of creativity. Students enjoy
          working on the Potter’s wheel. There is also provision for an electric
          furnace where firing of the artifacts is done.
