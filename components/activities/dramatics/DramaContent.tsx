          Dramatics is a very popular activity amongst the students. It helps to
          develop their communication skills. Here students not only learn the
          nuances of acting, but also the techniques of script writing,
          direction, set, sound and lights. Students showcase their art in
          various inter-school festivals, drama competitions and street plays.
