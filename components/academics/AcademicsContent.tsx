        West End School, Jhargram, stands tall as a commemorative edifice of the
        glorious milieu of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century
        Renaissance that swept across Bengal. From the early nineteenth century
        to the present date, Hindu School has splendidly lived up to its
        reputation of being a center of academic excellence. A long list of
        outstanding results in academia right from the year of 1878 till date
        provides a germane testimony.
