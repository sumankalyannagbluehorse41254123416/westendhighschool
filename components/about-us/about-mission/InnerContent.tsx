          Apart from the academic excellence, West End High School bears the
          vision of inculcating in the students the right moral values so that
          they grow up to be able citizens of tomorrow. We make every effort to
          ensure that our students are global citizens with an Indian heart.

          As the medium of instruction is English,cosiderable care and caution is
          being taken to help the students develop the skills of learning English
          correctly in real life situations.Perfection is what we seek to import
          to our children who in their formative stage would feel encouraged to
          learn with a passion. In this era of careerism and cut throat
          competition in various professional spheres both communicative and
          creative English have a wider acceptability in modern times.
