          The West End High School a wing of Women in Social Action – an NGO
          committed to the uplift of the people especially the under privileged
          tribals got off to a start with the avowed aim of working in the
          interior-most villages of the bordering areas of West Bengal, Bihar and
          Orissa.
          <br />
          <br />
          The school was founded in April 2000 by Women in Social Action(WSA) a
          registered non governmental organization to the eradication of
          illiteracy and carrying out committed pioneering work for welfare in
          and around Jhargram.
          <br />
          <br />
          The school is affiliated to the council for the Indian School
          Certificate Examinations, New Delhi. Apart from Jhargram, students are
          coming from different corners to study over here, attracted and allured
          not only by its sylvan surroundings but also by its style of teaching
          and functioning. In fact West End High School offers all that is
          expected of a modern english medium school. The main motto is – We can
          do it – it’s something of a stimulus that spurs us on to achieve what
          is best and grandest.
          <br />
          <br />
          We welcome all our prospective students and their guardians to be an
          integral part of our endeavour to produce high achievers with deep
          social commitment.
