          Staying connected with the people, we found that West End High School
          is the best way to reach them. Our findings confirmed the fact that
          poor language skills and incapacity to communicate are the problems at
          large of the students of this reason. Thus we have made English our
          medium of instruction. Language-learning with an emphasis on
          communicative functional approach would develop their competence and
          creativity to the fullest extent.

          We have found through various formal and non formal education projects
          that talented young students are deprived of an excellent career only
          because they are not fluent in English. We at the West End High School
          are thus determined to teach them communication skill in a scientific
          way through the medium of English.

          As the medium of instruction is English, considerable care and caution
          is being taken to help the students develop the skills of learning
          English correct pronunciation and conversational perfection is what we
          seek to impart to our children who in their formative stage would feel
          encouraged to learn with a passion. In this era of careerism and cut
          throat competition in various professional spheres both communicative
          and creative English have a wider acceptability in modern times.

          In his outstanding work Imaging India Nandan&nbsp;Nilekani most
          pertinently remarks the door of employment opportunities would be left
