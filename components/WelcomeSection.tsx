          Apart from the Academic Excellence, West End High School bears the
          vision of inculcating in the students the right moral values so that
          they grow up to be able citizens of tomorrow. We make every effort to
          ensure that our students are global citizens with an Indian heart. As
          the medium of instruction is English, considerable care and caution is
          being taken to help the students develop the skills of learning English
          correctly in real life situations. Perfection is what we seek to
          import to our children who in their formative stage would feel
          encouraged to learn with a passion. In this era of careerism and cut
          throat competition in various professional spheres both communicative
          and creative English have a wider acceptability in modern times.
